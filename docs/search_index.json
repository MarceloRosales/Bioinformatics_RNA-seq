Benefit: You can install all your tools in “Conda” and export as yml and you can share that environment or create a new one base on it, and by doing so, you can have all those tools automatically installed. 1.2 Install Miniconda, or Anaconda. Choose Anaconda if you: - Are new to conda or Python - Like the convenience of having Python and over 1500 scientific packages automatically installed at once - Have the time and disk space (a few minutes and 3 GB), and/or - Don’t want to install each of the packages you want to use individually. Choose Miniconda if you: - Do not mind installing each of the packages you want to use individually. - Do not have time or disk space to install over 1500 packages at once, and/or - Just want fast access to Python and the conda commands, and wish to sort out the other programs later. Mind that Windows and Mac installation and procedures are different. Does Windows need Linux to be intalled? Yes, a version of Linux kernell for window is available for download. Install Anaconda or Miniconda. brew install --cask anaconda brew install --cask miniconda # To check the version of conda installed. conda --version Quick video tutorial on how to use conda. * (Master) Conda environment. * Set up a data Science environment with Conda-Forge. To create an environment. The easy way: Open the anaconda app &gt; Environment &gt; New &gt; Name… Ok To access environment and open in terminal: anaconda app &gt; Environment &gt; Select environment &gt; rna-seq_test ^ &gt; »Open in Terminal. 1.2.1 Conda terminal commands.

This section was created based in this reference. After installing “conda,” and to gain time, download the genome of the species to be study. In this case, download the mouse (mus muslculus) genome file. This file contains the list of all the mouse genes and their codes. We need something to map our reads against once we get to the results. Files for mouse (Mus musculus) are available for download at Johns Hopkins University Center for Computational Biology (CCB) at TopHat. A spliced read mapper for RNA-Seq. There are different ways: Using tophat Using Star Custom/personal code. 1.3.1 Using Tophat (early version) Not Working!!! To download: 1. Look for the Mus musculus Build37.2 from the NCBI. 1. Right click the link and copy the link address. 1. go back to the conda environment and type wget and the paste the link. wget ftp://igenome:G3nom3s4u@ussd-ftp.illumina.com/Mus_musculus/NCBI/build37.2/Mus_musculus_NCBI_build37.2.tar.gz 1.3.2 Using Tophat Not Working!!! Tophat can be installed using the same conda install conda install \\-c bioconda tophat When this is finished installing, then we will need to get the mouse genome from the Johns Hopkins Univeristy Center for computational BIology. The version of the mouse genome that I am using here is the NCBI build37.2. Instead of downloading this from the website and having to move it to the cluser, I will just download it using wget into the folder that has the raw reads, trimmed reads, and the FastQC files. wget ftp://igenome:G3nom3s4u@ussd-ftp.illumina.com/Mus_musculus/NCBI/build37.2/Mus_musculus_NCBI_build37.2.tar.gz This will take a long time to download because the file is a little less than 16GB zipped. Installation of TopHat failed.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Try STAR 1.3.3 Using STAR Complicated!!! STAR can be installed the same way as the previous programs with conda install (conda install -c bioconda star). In order to run STAR, we need to creaate indices just like with tophat, but STAR has this built in. I’m going to be using the same genome and GTF file as previously downloaded, but Dr. Ge uses a different zipped genome from the gencode database. ~/miniconda2/bin/STAR \\ --runThreadN 80 \\ --runMode genomeGenerate \\ --genomeDir starIndex \\ --genomeFastaFiles Index/genome.fa \\ #same when we made the bowtie indices --sjdbGTFfile Mus_musculus/NCBI/build37.2/Annotation/Archives/archive-2015-07-17-14-32-40/Genes/genes.gtf With the index files made, we can start aligning with STAR. It’s important here than we only pick the paired end reads and not use all of the reads. Tophat is able to use all 4 reads but STAR doesn’t allow that, so we need to make sure that we feed in the large files from trimming. ~/miniconda2/bin/STAR --runThreadN 80 --genomeDir starIndex --readFilesIn 770_fp.fq 770_rp.fq --outFilterIntronMotifs RemoveNoncanonical --outFileNamePrefix 2121770 --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate [here]() Complicated.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1.3.4 Custom/personal way to Download the Mus_musculus_NCBI_build37.2.tar.gz file. Esaest so far. Go to the iGenomes Ready-To-Use Reference Sequences and Annotations from illumina.. Copy the Mus musculus (Mouse) NCBI build37.2 link. Paste the link in a new tab/window on a web browser (chrome) and click enter. Popup window will ask where to save the file, choose folder and save. File is 23Gb so it will take about 3 to 4 hrs to download. 1.3.5 Get the Sample files. Samples files come as “x_1.fastq.gz” or “x_2.fastq.gz,” where x is the name of the file, 1 is for forward and 2 for reverse pair reads. example: we will place them in a folder (00_Rawdata) mPDL_RNA7D_Ko1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz mPDL_RNA7D_Ko1_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz mPDL_RNA7D_Ko2_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz mPDL_RNA7D_Ko2_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz mPDL_RNA7D_Ko3_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz mPDL_RNA7D_Ko3_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz… etc…. Download multiqc conda install multiqc 1.3.6 Starting to analize fastq.gz files Initialize fastqc fastqc Make an output directory named rawFastQC mkdir rawFastQC Now we have to process all fastq files contained in the folder (00_Rawdata) and place the results in the directory we just made “rawFastQC.” fastqc rawFastQC/*.fastq.gz -o rawFastQC/ Once analysis is finished. Go to the results folder (rawFastQC) cd rawFastQC Create a report by read all the files contained in the results folder (rawFastQC) and combine them in one multiqc_report.html file. rawFastQC multiqc # check if file was created. ls 1.3.7 Trimming with Trimmomatic conda install trimmomatic # parallel my also be required for task piping. conda install parallel 24:40 Conda was used again to run Trimmomatic. This isn’t as easy as using the wildcard like with FastQC because each output has to be personalized for the read files that are input into Trimmomatic. Also, we have to make sure that the adapter sequences are in the same folder that we are running so we can refer to them easily when calling the Trimmomatic program. In this case, we are using the TruSeq3-PE-2.fa adapter sequences For example: ~/miniconda2/bin/trimmomatic PE SRR2121770_1.fastq.gz SRR2121770_2.fastq.gz 770_fp.fq.gz 770_fu.fq.gz 770_rp.fq.gz 770_ru.fq.gz ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE-2.fa:2:30:10:2keepBothReads LEADING:3 TRALING:3 MINLEN:36 &amp; This would be repeated for each of the pairs (12 in total). We are trimming paired-end reads with the TruSeq3-PE-2 adapters. We are chopping off the first and last 3 bases and if we end up with a sequence less than 36 bases, we get rid of it. We want to make sure that there are enough bases in a read to work with. These parameters can be tweaked for possibly better end results with less being discarded. When Trimmomatic is finished running, it will out put the total number of reads, the total number from both the forward and reverse reads that are kept, the number of only forward reads kept, the number of only reverse reads kept, and the number of discarded reads. The trimmed reads can be analyzed again with FastQC to see how well the trimming worked to make the file better quality. After running FastQC on the trimmed files we see that the quality of those that were really bad quality were improved. There were a few different metrics throughout all of the files that bounced from a warning before the failing, or from passing before to a warning, and so forth, overall creating better quality read files. Read Check Undrstantig Trimmomatic tutorial for this section !!!!!! after trimmomatic, files will be created, .gz and .log files. Use multiqc to merge all logs in one report file. Then check the timmomatic survival Reads. If all samples are over 55M (million) reads then samples are valid for further analysis. Check the order again. Trimmomatic &gt; alligment -&gt; w/ TopHap or STAR 1.3.8 Using STAR to map genes Using the Mus_musculus files we will compare our samples and find where in the genome our reads are. &gt; Build Genome Indexing and useful STAR Flags (quick).

Export of networks to external software: PDF document, R script 2.1.4 3.4 Gene expression analysis The level of gene expression is measured by read density, the higher the read density, the higher the level of gene expression. Gene expression calculation was performed with the formula below, which calculates FPKM (Fragments per kilo bases per million reads) based on read counts from HT-seq (V 0.6.1) (Mortazavi, 2008). The formula is: Figure 3.4.1 The ratio of (total exon fragments / mapped reads [millions]) is the read count mapped to the gene normalized to total read counts. The value is then normalized to gene length (exon length [KB]), so that the expression of genes with different sequencing depths and length are comparable. The numbers of genes with different expression levels are summarized in Table 3.7.1. In general, FPKM threshold for gene expression is set between 0.1-1, although there is no absolute standard and various thresholds have been used in the literature. 2.2 RNA-seq Analisys with Kaku’s Data sample. 2021/07/02 Copy Trial data from MK/土橋 to folder : The Report file. The Summary file Report ### Experimental Workflow. Transcriptome sequencing experiments include: * RNA extraction and QC (Quality Control?), * Library construction, * Purification, * Library QC and * Quantitation, as well as * Sequencing cluster generation and high through-put sequencing. Each step is important for data quality and quantity, which in turn affect the data analysis. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis results, every step is under strict monitoring and quality control. After mixing libraries based on their effective concentration and the required sequencing data volume, Illumina platform is used for high through-put sequencing. 2.2.1 Data Analysis.

Create environment. Init environment conda install sra-tools This will allow us to pull directly from the sra page. (where the sample ex. Files) Go to page. Select only files needed. Then in the Selected &gt; click on Accession List &gt; Save Drag onto the file structure, so its now in system ls to see the files (SRR_Acc_List.txt) Check ‘head SRR_Acc_List.txt’ command Also you can use the vi SRR_Acc_List.txt command to see the list in the file. Ex. ①. SRR2121770\\ ②. SRR2121771\\ ③. SRR2121774\\ ④. SRR2121778\\ ⑤. Etc. Now that we have the list of files, we have to individually download each one of them. One way to do that is with the fastq-dump --gzi --split-file SRR2121770 &amp; command. ①. This command will take the SRR2121770 file, and save it as a .gzi file (to save space) ②. it will split the file in forward (1) and Reverse (2), then ③. the “&amp;” sign means that it will run this command in the background. This will take some time since the file is big. A way to see if the process is finished or not is with the command jobs, which gives a list of the jobs in process or nothing if there are not jobs running. Another way to do it is with the pipe command, so we don’t have to do this process for each file. Use the command cat SRR_Acc_List.txt | parallel fastq-dump --gzi --split-file {}. ①. This will take the SRR_Acc_List.txt and catalog the list.\\ ②. Then it will take each of the element in the list &quot;{}&quot; slipt them, and save them as gzi. ③. In the rawReads folder???.. you will have a list of .fastq.gz_1 and .fastq.gz_2 for each element of the list. `…rawReads$ ls`. ④. Each time something is changed in the files, create a new folder and save there so the originals are not modified. Ex. Trimmed. Once all files are downloaded, install multiqc. conda install multiqc. (if not installed) Before running fastqc, create an output directory where to save the processed files. mkdir rawFastQC (make sure you are in the right directory before making this folder). Then run fastqc: fastqc -t 64 rawReads/*fastqc.gz -o rawFastQC This means, process files with fastqc using 64 treads (-t 64) windows/linux virtual machine; by taking all fastqc.gz files in the folder rawReads; and save in the output directory (-o) called rawFastQC. This process will take a long time depending on the number and size of the files. Once finished cd rawFastQC and check the files ls Then inside the forlder, run multiqc in multiqc. Once this finished, inside the folder a new “multiqc_report.html” will be created. Open the files and compare. 22:29 Once this quality control is finished we can pass to the trimming of the samples. Install trimmomatic, conda install trimmomatic (if not installed). If we are going to trim the files, we need to make a new folder, so exit rawFastQC folder. cd.. and mkdir trimmedReads, we are going to point trimmomatic the this folder. We are going to pull our true adapter sequences to our working directory. Then it will be a lot easier to point trimmomatic to that vs havint to type in the really long path. cp ~/miniconda3/envs/name_of_environment/share/trimmomatic-0.39-1/adapters/TrueSeq3-PE-2.fa . (the last point is important, it means that the command will the done in this folder). Now run the trimmomatic.
